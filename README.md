# SBA319MongoDBDatabaseApplication

// Objectives of the Project

- Create a server application with Node, Express, and MongoDB.
- Create a CRUD API using Express and MongoDB.
- Create MongoDB indexes.
- Use MongoDB indexing to make efficient queries.
- Create MongoDB validation rules.
- Use MongoDB validation to ensure data consistency.


// Steps 

- I created a small Node, Express and MongoDB server application;

- I used the sample training database from MongoDB. I am creating CRUD API 

  for the "posts" and "grades" data collections from the sample training database. 

- I created one data collection - "comments" - in the sample training database. 

- For the comments api: POST route was created and I populated 10 documents. And thru the GET route I displayed the comments. DELETE And Put by 

  ID routes are created. And all tested thru REQBIN  and it worked. I deleted one and updated one of the documents I populated. 

- For the - posts - data collection I created GET route to display all the posts, thru Id and author/authorName.

- And I tested and populated 13 sample data thru post request to posts data collection and I was able to update and delete the data 

  through Delete and PUT requests. 

- The third data collection "grades" - I was able to GET the data by the learners_id and used POST to populate 12 documents as well. 

- In all data collection data validation was used.
