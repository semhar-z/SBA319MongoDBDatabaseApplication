// Steps 

- I created a small Node, Express and MongoDB server application;

- I have decided to work on the sample training database from MongoDB. I am creating CRUD API 

  for the posts and grades data collections from the sample training database. 

- I created one data collection - comments - in the sample training database. 

- For the comments api: POST route was created and I populated 10 documents. And thru the GET route I displayed the comments. DELETE And Put by ID routes are created. And all tested thru REQBIN and it worked. I deleted one and updated one of the documents I populated. 

- For the - posts - data collection I created GET route to display all the posts, thru Id and author/authorName.

- And I tested and populated 10 sample data thru post request to posts data collection
